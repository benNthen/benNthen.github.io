                <h2>Cultural Blog - Mindset</h2>

                <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
                <p>Understanding its principles can help make it easier and more fun for people to get immersed into the subject that the learning material is about.
                Unlocking how it works can help make it faster to absorb new information that I am learning while studying at Dev Academy.
                </p>
                <p>In order to increase neuroplasticity we must do the following:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                  <li>Repetition of task: by repeating an activity, retrieving a memory, and reviewing material in a variety of ways helps build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.</li>
                  <li>Put information in context: creating engaging content such as materials that relate to everyday lives. This will make it easier for us to absorb information. </li>
                  <li>Understanding how the brain works: by breaking down myths and making us all believe that things are achieveable if "we put our mind into it".</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
                <p>It is about having the right beliefs that you can grow and excel in a certain area of learning. It is relevant because it can be the source of 
                 drive and inspiration to succeed in the software development industry. We are all in the process of changing to a different career path so must have patience 
                 and a goal to aspire.</p>
                <p>I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey, by being consistent things such as timming how long I spend on an each task and celebrating small achievements such as solving problems. 
                  I hope these things will help improve my growth mindset and allow me to achieve big things.
                </p>
                <h3>Blend with my learning plan and strategies</h3>
                <p>Overall, I feel that Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset are concepts that has allowed me to understand how things are being taught to me and by taking them onboard
                  I will be able to overcome barriers and prejudices that would otherwise prevent me from striving to excel in the field of software development.
                </p>
