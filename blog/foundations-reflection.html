              <h2>Core Reflection</h2>
              <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>I have learned that I am shy, calm and collective. These are traits that are not gonna change but I can find alternative ways to still be attentive and energized when it comes to learning new things.</p></li>
                </ul>
              <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>To help us analyze problems and have a better understanding of real life situations that we may often face while learning, doing a difficult task or facing a conflict while working with someone. This in return helps us come up with good problem-solving skills and a growth mindset.</p></li>
                </ul>
              <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>I feel like Core learning helped me understand what the facilitators are trying to do to their students and in return this makes me appreciate their work and understand their expectations from me.</p></li>
                </ul>
              <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>The most challenging aspect was writing long blogs, making time for pair programming and reading up on the long material online.</p></li>
                </ul>
              <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>So we can understand and appreciate the learning material given to us. And also to give us an indication of what they expect us to know and what answers future employers are expecting us to give during job interviews.</p></li>
                </ul>
              <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>Sometimes I feel this way that core learning is a waste, but in reality its actually good to take a break from stressing so much about learning new technology (which is the impression everyone has about coding bootcamps). Core learning helps us reflect and think more deeply about our learning strategies so we can achieve our goals of becoming developers who often spend the rest of their spare time learning and studying coding when ever there are no projects on the pipeline yet.</p></li>
