                <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</h3>
                <p>It is the concept of having the ability to monitor how you perceive how others feel. This is important while you are in 
                  the workforce. Being able to chanel the energy of others or put yourself in other people's shoes, is a great way to 
                  prevent conflicts from happening at work. </p>

                <h3>What is Intelligence Quotient (IQ)</h3>
                <p>It is the total score derived from the set of tests or subtests designed to assess human intelligence.</p>
                <p>In some areas of the academia and workforce, people often undertake tests to see what their IQ is and is apparently the 
                  way to tell if someone is intelligent.</p>
                
                <h3>What is Mindfulness/Meditation Practice</h3>
                <p>They are routines that can help cultivate focus and attention. They are not there to help keep our minds clear and calm but to encourage
                  us to listen more effectively by reflecting upon how much information we were able to re-collect by carrying out these routines.
