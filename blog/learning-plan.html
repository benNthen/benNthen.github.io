              <h2>Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>I want to beome a successful Full Stack Developer who can learn different tech stacks, work on different projects and assist different teams.</p></li>
                  <li><p>My biggest strength is that I am already experienced in coding and have done some on my spare time. My biggest limitation is that I am also working and I am planning to look for another developer job, which could take a toll on my commitments due to the preparation and tests required. </p></li> 
                  <li><p>My biggets non-technical challenge would be to stay committed to the work and this includes working with groups, where I must contribute an equal amount of work with the rest of the team.</p></li>
                  <li><p>I would like to learn how to ask more questions, work with groups and develop leadership skills when it comes to working in projects both independently and with a team.</p></li>
                  <li><p>My expectations for Bootcamp is that they can help mentor me to improve my technical and professional skills. I hope they will help me as much as the Foundations team did.</p></li>
                  <li><p>My expectations for myself during Bootcamp is that I can finish each Sprint at a more steady phase, not fall behind and be able to stay on schedule. I also hope that I can land a Developer or IT-related job soon. In addition, I want to improve and expand on my technical skills coding especially with front and back-end framework. I also hope that I will ask my facilitators more questions and be more engaged at Discord.</p></li>
                </ul>
              <h2>Learning Plan - Foundations</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>My long-term career goal is to improve my coding skills, understand product requirements set out by clients and grow as a Full Stack Engineer.</p></li>
                  <li><p>When it comes to learning my main strength is that I’m a self-starter so I can work with under minimal supervision, and I have a strong aptitude to learn things quickly because I can break larger complex things down to smaller sections.</p></li> 
                  <li><p>One of my limitations is that I tend to procrastinate due to low self-esteem especially when it comes to tackling complex tasks that I’ve never done before. The other limitation I tend to have is that I have a pacing problem, so I sometimes need to stop and repeat something. When things start to build up, I will take a break or let the Facilitators if I need help.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The way I empathize with the end-users who will be using the applications that I developed. Communicating with an agile-scrum team that works in an IT business setting.</p></li>
                  <li><p>I will learn to manage the amount of time spent on each Sprint project by using the Toggl Track app. I will communicate with the facilitators and other colleagues of the Pikopiko intake in a respectful manner by posting messages on Discord.</p></li>
                  <li><p>When I get stuck on a problem for more than a couple of hours, I should start asking the facilitators questions or take a break.</p></li>
                  <li><p>I expect that the Facilitation team will be there to support or mentor me along the way.</p></li>
                  <li><p>I work on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Mondays each week, from 7am to 3pm, so I tend to have only Tuesday and Wednesday to commit to my studies.</p></li>
