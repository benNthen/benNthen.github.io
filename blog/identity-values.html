                <h3>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h3>

                <p>According to allright.org.nz’s Strengths Finder results my signature strengths are: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Humility (Temperance): Letting one's accomplishments speak for themselves; not regarding oneself as more special than one is. </li>
                  <li>Teamwork (Justice): Working well as a member of a group of teams; being loyal to the group; doing one’s share.</li>
                  <li>Appreciation of Beauty & Excellence (Transcendence):  Noticing and appreciating beauty, excellence, and/or skilled performance in various domains of life, from nature to art to mathematics to science to everyday experience.</li>
                  <li>Love of Learning (Wisdom):  Mastering new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge, whether on one's own or formally; related to the strength of curiosity but goes beyond it to describe the tendency to add systematically to what one knows.</li>
                  <li>Hope (Transcendence): Expecting the best in the future and working to achieve it; believing that a good future is something that can be brought about.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>Stories of how these values were demonstrated in practice.</p>
                <p>An achievement that I am proud of was when I worked as a Food Laboratory Technician for the Pathogens team, there was a time when we arranged a roster for our work to come early, on-time and overtime to process all the results for a client. We then stayed committed to this rooster for at least 2 weeks. Whenever there was a problem, we would encourage each other to speak up. In the end, the client was happy with our work and we got rewarded with free food from them which were actually the products that we helped them test for quality assurance and food safety purposes.</p>
                
                <p>Whakataukī (proverbs) or quotes that sum up your values</p>

                <blockquote>“We learn from failure, not from success!” - Bram Stoker.</blockquote>
